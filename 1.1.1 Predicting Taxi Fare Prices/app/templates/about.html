    <p>
        This web app demonstrates the <strong>NYC Taxi Fare Prediction</strong> project.
        It estimates the cost of a taxi ride in New York City based on pickup and drop-off locations,
        travel distance, and time-related information. The goal is to provide accurate and interactive
        fare predictions for educational and demonstration purposes.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">How it Works</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Data preprocessing and feature engineering for the taxi trip dataset.</li>
        <li>Model training with a regression-based approach to predict fares.</li>
        <li>Feature extraction includes distance, hour of day, day of week, and month.</li>
        <li>FastAPI backend serving predictions via a REST API.</li>
        <li>Interactive front-end allows both manual input and batch file uploads.</li>
        <li>Real-time feedback displays estimated fare instantly below the input form.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt-4">Why This Project is Useful</h3>
    <p>
        Understanding taxi fare dynamics can help:
        <ul>
            <li>Students and developers learn machine learning workflow end-to-end.</li>
            <li>Experiment with feature engineering and model deployment.</li>
            <li>Demonstrate practical applications of regression modeling in urban transportation.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
        This application is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only.
        Do not use it for real-world fare calculations or business decisions without proper validation.
